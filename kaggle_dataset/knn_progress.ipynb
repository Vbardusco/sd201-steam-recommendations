    "# Recommendations based on hours played : k-nn on players\n",
    "The aim of the algorithm is to predict a list of games someone may like knowing how much he played to other games.\n",
    "It means that the feature we want to predict is a list of games, and the features used to do so are, for each game in the database, the amount of hours spent playing this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then want X, Y like this :  \n",
    "X = [0,0,...,0,5.2,0,10,...]  \n",
    "Y = [0,1,1,0,0,1,...] (the one-encoded vector of the games liked) \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the k neighbors, we will use the L2 distance on the vectors of hours played for each game.  \n",
    "With this distance, firstly people that played a lot the same games will be near from each other, but it will also cluster types of players : those who play a lot of different games will be together, and the niche player will be separated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make a prediction, we will compute using this distance the k neighbors of a player, and make a prediction.  \n",
    "For this prediction, the k-nn algorithm usually choses the majority class of the neighbors. Thus, we could define a class as the one-hot-encoding of the games played by the user. However, this may lead to 1 class per neighbor, as it is highly possible that every player in the neighborhood, even if they are close one to each other, have tried a game the other ones never played to.  \n",
    "That's why we choose as a result to give the union of all the games played by the neighbors. This will guarantee that the games resulting will be chosen because they are characteristical of the neighborhood.  \n",
    "Obviously, we will remove from the result the games already played by the initial player (we don't want to recommand to someone a game he already played for 200 hours...)"
